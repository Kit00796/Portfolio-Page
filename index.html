                <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer and I wanted to create a space where you could check out a collection of what kind of things I've done so far. Most of my projects are constantley changing. Whenever I learn something new I love to test it out and put it to work.</p>   
                <p>I have always been facinated with graphic design and photograph. Naturally, front end programming called out to me. Learning how to program and the level of detail that can be brought to a webpage has opened an entirley new world for me. I've come to learn that this new world would be incomplete if I'm only ever working on just the head and not the entire body. So began my path to becoming a full stack engineer.</p>
                <p>I hope that you enjoy your visit here and, if all goes well, you draw some inspiration from what I've created</p>
