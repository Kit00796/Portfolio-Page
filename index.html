                <p id="open-line">My name is Chris Rosario...<br> but you can call me Kit.</p> 
                <p>As a driven software engineer with a knack for problem-solving, I find joy in crafting elegant and efficient code. I have 2 years of experience building and maintaining web applications, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies. My passion lies in clean code, user-friendly interfaces, and building software that makes a real difference. </p>  
                <!--<p>I have always loved art and graphic design is just another medium. Naturally, front end programming called out to me. Learning how to program and the level of detail that can be brought to a webpage has opened an entirley new world for me. It hasn't stopped there, though as I have continued to learn more languges and how they can be used to improve prexisting projects as well as create new ones. </p>
                <p>I wanted to create a space where you could check out a collection of projects I've worked on so far. Most of my projects are constantley changing. Whenever I learn something new I love to test it out and put it to work.</p>-->

                <p>This website is "I need a break". It started as just a pahe to practiceand sharpen my skills, but it has evolved and continues to be a passion project for me. I've had the great opportunity talking with many programmers (whether though forums or in person) and they all lent me the same bit of advice: <b>"Know when to take a break!"</b>.</p> 
                <p>The idea for this project was to create a space where programmers can come to unwind. It would include games and puzzles that had a programming theme as well as its own dedicated forum area where people could connect with each other. Another sectiton would be dedicated to reading material, whether it be "what's going on in the world of tech" or a maybe a few sections of things that are as far away from tech and programming as they could be.</p>
                <p>This project hold a special place for me and I have very big plans for it as it's something that not only I may benefit from, but something that thousands may find helpful.</p>

                <p>This webpage is titled "Silver Fins". This project was my first "built-from-scratch" websites. It is a mock page for a swim club that focuses on swimming the lakes of New England.</p>
                <p>I've been a swimming fanatic for my entire life, so I made this page as something that I would hope to find. I wanted to keep the layout as a simple, singular page as those who are looking for a club may not want to click 6 different nav items just to find days/times/locations. </p>

                <p>With this project I wanted to do something more practical; something that could be used by anyone or everyone who has no idea what they want to cook. </p>
                <p>This meal generator has a variety of food categories and styles. It's designed to be able to come up with a random mix and combined will inspire someone to create something (hopefully delicious).</p>
